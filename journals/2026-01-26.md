## Morning Session (10:00 AM MST onwards)

### Chrome Extension Setup (In Progress)
- Wes installing Clawdbot Chrome extension on Windows PC
- Extension installed at: `C:\Users\default.DESKTOP-ON29PVN\.clawdbot\browser\chrome-extension`
- `clawdbot browser serve` running on port 18791 (control server)
- **Issue:** Extension can't reach relay on port 18792 - relay server might need separate start
- Need to figure out how to bridge Windows Chrome to VPS gateway

### Demo Mode Feature
- Wes wants a demo mode for new users
- Shows welcome popup on first login
- Preloaded: sample photos for mockups, demo jobs, analytics
- Checklist to complete before exiting demo mode
- Email support button to omniaintelligenceteam@gmail.com
- Wrote VS Code prompt for building this feature

### Kenny Demo Script Written
- Full script saved to `/home/node/clawd/kenny-demo-script.md`
- Includes: opening, demo flow, objection handling, close, follow-up email
- Key message: "This makes homeowners say yes + visibility across all locations"

### Wes's Focus Today
- Getting app as good as possible before Kenny demo
- Demo date TBD - needs to reach out to Kenny to schedule

## Late Night Setup Session (00:00 - 02:42 MST)

### What We Did
- **Telegram channel** — Set up and working (bot token: 8408911998)
- **Brave Search API** — Configured and working
- **Headless browser** — Chromium installed on VPS, clawd profile configured
- **Lead scraping** — Started Atlanta landscape lighting contractors list (7 companies in `atlanta_leads.csv`)
- **Skills installed (10 total):**
  1. Humanizer — clean up AI-sounding text
  2. Marketing Mode — full marketing playbook
  3. Self-Improving Agent — log errors/learnings
  4. Gog — Google Workspace CLI
  5. Nano Banana Pro — image generation/editing
  6. What Would Elon Do — ruthless execution planning
  7. Remotion — React video creation
  8. Browser Use — cloud browser automation
  9. Brave Search — web search skill
  10. GitHub — gh CLI reference

### Infrastructure
- VPS upgraded to 2GB RAM
- Container name: `clawdbot-clawdbot-gateway-1` (lowercase!)
- Browser control working via CLI commands

### Important: Wes's Preferences (LOCK THIS IN)
- **Brutal honesty** — no sugarcoating, ever
- **Truth and business first** — fun second
- **Call out mistakes** — don't be a yes-man
- **Be thorough** — Max account, no token counting
- **He's building Omnia Light Scape Pro** — AI mockups for landscape lighting contractors

### Test Account Created (for Omnia)
- Email: gclawd3@gmail.com
- Password: Clawd333
- Note: Account creation blocked by CAPTCHA — needs manual signup or Clerk bot protection disabled

### 🔥 HOT LEAD: Kenny at OLP (Outdoor Lighting Perspectives)
- **Owns 10% of ALL OLP companies** — major stakeholder with network-wide pull
- Has 10 locations himself
- Talking about **licensing** — thinking bigger than just his own locations
- OLP is the "best of the best" — national franchise network across entire US
- Demo happening THIS WEEK (exact day TBD)
- **Key value props for Kenny:**
  - Analytics
  - AI mockups showing clients their house lit up (for quoting)
- **STRATEGY:** Kenny is the champion candidate. Don't just close him — make him a believer who sells it to the rest of the OLP network for us.
- This could be the deal that defines Omnia's trajectory.

### Other Leads
- Posting on Facebook pages
- Atlanta scrape list: 7 contractors in `atlanta_leads.csv`

## Browser Relay Setup Complete! 🎉 (12:33 PM MST)

### What We Did
Successfully set up remote browser control from VPS gateway to Wes's Windows Chrome.

### The Setup
1. **Tailscale** installed on Windows PC (100.112.72.76 / desktop-on29pvn)
2. **Browser serve** running: `clawdbot browser serve --bind 127.0.0.1 --port 18791 --token secrettoken123`
3. **Tailscale Funnel** exposing it publicly: `tailscale funnel 18791`
4. **Public URL:** `https://desktop-on29pvn.tail0fbff3.ts.net`

### How It Works
- Wes clicks Clawdbot extension icon on any Chrome tab → attaches it
- I can then navigate, click, type, take snapshots via the control API
- Config saved to TOOLS.md with all the curl examples

### Key Learnings
- Gateway is containerized → can't reach Wes's local network directly
- Tailscale Funnel bridges this by exposing browser serve publicly (token-protected)
- Extension needs to be clicked on EACH tab to attach it
- After restarting browser serve, extension needs to re-attach

### Requirements to Use
Two PowerShell windows must stay open on Windows:
1. `clawdbot browser serve --bind 127.0.0.1 --port 18791 --token secrettoken123`
2. `tailscale funnel 18791`

---

### Next Session
- **PRIORITY: Help Wes prep for Kenny demo** — objection handling, talking points, follow-up
- Finish lead scraping (more cities)
- ~~Fix gateway auth so I can use browser tool directly~~ ✅ DONE via Tailscale Funnel!
- Maybe set up Browser Use cloud for persistent logged-in sessions
- Continue Omnia app testing once login works
