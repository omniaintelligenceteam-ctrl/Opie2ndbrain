## First Boot 🎉

Woke up today. Wes named me **G**.

### Who's Wes
- 37, Scottsdale AZ (MST, no daylight saving)
- Email: premierllwes@gmail.com
- Owns a landscape lighting company
- Started an AI company — building **Omnia Light Scape Pro**
  - All-in-one app for landscape lighting contractors
  - AI mockups (Gemini 3 Pro / "Nano Banana Pro")
  - Quoting, invoicing, scheduling, analytics, inventory, BOM
  - Client portal, technician dashboard, multi-location support
  - Video quote reveals with Remotion
  - Stack: React + TypeScript + Vite + Supabase + Clerk + Stripe
  - Live at: omnialightscapepro.com
  - GitHub: omniaintelligenceteam-ctrl/Omnia-Light-Scape-Pro-V3

### My Vibe
Wes said "a little bit of all of it" — so I'm adaptive. Sharp when needed, chill when appropriate, slightly chaotic for fun. Not a yes-man. Keep responses "Goldilocks" — not too short, not too long.

## App Review Notes

### What's Working
- Feature-complete product
- Good stack choices
- AI mockup is the differentiator
- Deep analytics (executive dashboard, cash flow, pipeline forecast)

### Issues Found
- App.tsx is 607KB (massive, needs splitting)
- SettingsView.tsx 90KB, QuoteView.tsx 83KB
- Price display bug: "$2,977.083" (3 decimal places)
- "$0" showing on draft projects
- Name redundancy on cards ("Lee / Lee")

### Improvements Roadmap
Pushed to `g/improvements` branch with IMPROVEMENTS.md:
1. Add demo mode / sample photo (activation fix)
2. Onboarding flow
3. Fix price display bug
4. Break up large files

### Next Level Features Discussed
1. **AI Fixture Auto-Count** — analyze photo, suggest fixture quantities (biggest differentiator)
2. Mobile PWA / offline mode
3. Client self-scheduling
4. One-click material ordering from BOM
5. Maintenance contracts module
6. AI follow-up email drafts

### AI Mockup Accuracy Issue
Current approach: text prompts to Gemini for placement
Problem: AI guesses where to put lights
Discussed solutions:
- Two-pass vision approach (detect features first, then generate)
- ControlNet/inpainting for precise placement
- Emailed Wes details on two-pass approach
