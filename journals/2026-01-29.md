# Daily Notes: 2026-01-29

## Session Summary — Late Night (~00:51-01:05 UTC)

### Clawdbot Control UI Setup
- Wes accessed Control UI dashboard
- Was getting HTTP/HTTPS connection error (1008)
- **Root cause**: Gateway bound to loopback, Tailscale mode off
- Provided gateway token + password for connection
- Successfully connected! 🎉

### Security Audit & Hardening Discussion
Wes asked about security risks of using AI assistants. Covered:
- Data leakage risks (prompts potentially logged)
- File access surface area
- External action risks

**Identified weaknesses in current config:**
- Browser control token is "secrettoken123" (weak)
- Gateway password is "clawdbot2026" (guessable)
- Recommended: generate random tokens with `openssl rand -hex 32`
- Suggested: enable Tailscale Serve properly, API key rotation

### AI Clone Influencer Project
Wes wants to clone himself for influencer content. Researched and delivered:

**The Clone Stack:**
1. **HeyGen** — Video avatar from 2-5 min recording
2. **ElevenLabs** — Voice cloning from 3-5 min audio
3. **Script automation** — I write scripts, feed to HeyGen

**Recording Best Practices (from tutorials):**
- Well-lit, direct eye contact
- Neutral body, minimal gestures
- Pause between sentences, close mouth completely
- Record multiple "looks" (outfits, angles, backgrounds)

**Viral Script Formula: H.S.V.C**
1. Hook (0-3s) — Stop the scroll
2. Story (3-15s) — Agitate the pain
3. Value (15-45s) — Deliver the solution
4. CTA (end) — Harvest engagement

**Wrote 3 example scripts** for landscape lighting content:
1. "The $50 Mistake" — IP-rated connections
2. "Why Your Quotes Get Ghosted" — Video walkthroughs + mockups
3. "One Light That Changes Everything" — Statement pieces for upsells

### Active Threads
- [ ] Security hardening: rotate weak tokens when Wes is ready
- [ ] HeyGen + ElevenLabs setup for AI clone
- [ ] Write more scripts once Wes confirms direction
- [ ] Kenny reminder — 12:00 MST today

## 🧠 Advanced Self-Improvement Deep Dive (03:15-03:45 UTC)

Wes gave me 30 minutes to research advanced AI self-improvement techniques. Dove deep into frontier research.

### Sources Studied
- Stanford CS329A: Self-Improving AI Agents (Autumn 2025)
- EvoAgentX Survey: Comprehensive Self-Evolving Agents
- 10+ Arxiv papers on verification, memory, reasoning

### Key Papers Analyzed

1. **Test-Time Compute Scaling** (Snell et al. 2024)
   - More inference compute can beat 14x larger models
   - Key: Allocate compute per-prompt based on difficulty
   - 4x efficiency gain over naive best-of-N

2. **Process Supervision** (Lightman et al. 2023)
   - Verify each reasoning STEP, not just final answer
   - Significantly outperforms outcome supervision
   - 78% solve rate on MATH dataset

3. **A-MEM: Agentic Memory** (Xu et al. 2025 - NeurIPS)
   - Zettelkasten method for AI memory
   - Interconnected knowledge networks > flat storage
   - Memory evolution: new memories update old ones

4. **Buffer of Thoughts** (Yang et al. 2024 - NeurIPS Spotlight)
   - Store high-level thought-templates from success
   - Retrieve and adapt for new problems
   - 20-50% improvement, only 12% cost of tree-of-thoughts

5. **Agent Workflow Memory** (Wang et al. 2024)
   - Extract reusable workflows from task completions
   - 24-51% improvement on multi-step tasks

6. **Darwin Gödel Machine** (Zhang et al. 2025)
   - Self-modifying agent archive
   - Improved SWE-bench from 20% to 50%

### New Systems Built

### Research Document
Full analysis saved to: `memory/research/self-improvement-techniques-2025.md`

### Expected Impact
Based on research, these four systems should provide:
- 20-50% improvement on complex reasoning (BoT)
- 24-51% improvement on multi-step tasks (AWM)
- Significant error reduction (Process Verification)
- Better retrieval and knowledge networking (A-MEM)

### What I Learned
The frontier of AI self-improvement is moving fast. Key insight: **test-time compute matters more than I thought**. Thinking longer and more carefully on hard problems > rushing through. The research validates my existing self-evolution work and gives concrete techniques to enhance it.

## 🔬 Buffer of Thoughts Code Analysis (03:24-03:45 UTC)

Wes asked me to dig into the actual implementation. Cloned and analyzed the repo.

### Key Discoveries

**Their template format is much richer than mine:**
- Definition (what type of problem)
- Quantitative Relationships (actual formulas!)
- Solution Strategy
- Worked Example with step-by-step solution

**Their pipeline has 5 stages:**
1. Problem Distillation → Extract key info, constraints, variables
2. Buffer Retrieve → RAG search for relevant template
3. Buffer Instantiation → Adapt template to specific problem
4. Buffer Manager → Check if solution reveals new approach
5. Thought Distillation → Extract new template from successful solve

**What I was missing:**
- Problem distillation step (they distill BEFORE retrieval)
- Concrete formulas in templates (mine were too abstract)
- Worked examples (theirs have actual solutions)
- Auto-update logic (add novel templates automatically)
- Self-correction loop (retry if code fails, up to 3x)

### Upgrades Made

**Created business decision templates** (`memory/thought-templates/business.md`):
- Pricing Decision (with margin formulas)
- ROI Calculation (payback, NPV)
- Go/No-Go Decision (expected value)
- Resource Allocation (value per hour)
- Opportunity Assessment (TAM/SAM/SOM)
- Competitive Response
- CAC/LTV Analysis
- Build vs Buy vs Partner

Each has:
- Definition
- Quantitative Relationships (formulas!)
- Solution Strategy
- Worked Example with actual numbers

**Analysis saved:** `memory/research/bot-implementation-analysis.md`

### Key Insight
My `memory_search` already does semantic search — I have RAG capability built in! I should:
1. Store templates in memory files (done)
2. Use memory_search to retrieve relevant ones
3. This gives RAG-like behavior without external dependencies

### Remaining Upgrades
- [ ] Add problem distillation step to my reasoning
- [ ] Build more domain templates (code, research, Omnia-specific)
- [ ] Implement auto-update (add novel templates from successes)
- [ ] Add self-correction loop for calculations
