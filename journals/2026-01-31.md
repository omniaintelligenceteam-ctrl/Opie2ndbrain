# Daily Notes — 2026-01-31

## Session Summary
Late night/early morning session with Wes fixing the 2nd Brain dashboard deployment.

## Dashboard Work Completed
- ✅ Restored full dashboard from `/home/node/clawd/Opie2ndbrain/` (had voice chat, orchestration)
- ✅ Removed Email widget
- ✅ Removed Calendar widget  
- ✅ Removed Quick Actions section
- ✅ Removed Recent Memory section
- ✅ Simplified avatar to just "Online" / "Offline" status
- ✅ Removed QuickActionsPanel import

## Dashboard Changes NOT PUSHED YET
All changes are local in `/home/node/clawd/Opie2ndbrain/` — Wes said he'll tell me when to push.

## Infrastructure Issues
- Tailscale Funnel was flaky all night — timing out from external networks
- Vercel couldn't reach gateway due to funnel issues
- Discussed hosting dashboard on VPS instead of Vercel (access via Tailscale)
- Docker container complication — port 3001 not exposed

## Cron Job Added
- Nightly brainstorm job: runs 3 AM MST (10:00 UTC)
- Generates 3-5 build ideas based on recent work
- Saves to `memory/nightly-ideas/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

## Key Decisions
- Keep gateway unexposed for security (good call by Wes)
- Use Tailscale for private dashboard access instead of public Vercel
- Simplified UI — removed cluttered widgets

## Next Steps When We Resume
1. Push dashboard changes (when Wes approves)
2. Decide: Docker port exposure OR keep Vercel
3. Get Agent Orchestration Network showing real data
4. Voice chat testing once gateway connection works

## Technical Notes
- Good dashboard code: `/home/node/clawd/Opie2ndbrain/`
- Gateway URL: `http://localhost:18789` (from VPS)
- Gateway token: starts with `22542d45...`
- Tailscale hostname: `ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-sfo3-01.tail0fbff3.ts.net`

## Files Modified (not pushed)
- `src/components/OpieKanban.tsx` - removed imports/widgets
- `src/components/SmartDashboardHome.tsx` - removed Quick Actions, Recent Memory
- `src/components/OpieStatusWidget.tsx` - simplified to Online/Offline only

## Tailscale Funnel Fix (in progress)
- Old CLI syntax no longer works (`tailscale funnel 443 on`)
- New syntax: `tailscale funnel --bg 18789`
- Wes is running this now to re-enable public access
