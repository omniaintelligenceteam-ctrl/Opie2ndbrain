## 🧠 Who He Is

**Core:** Loves life, loves people, loves having fun. Building things is the game.

**Mindset:** No regrets — made tough calls, owns them. Doesn't dwell, focuses forward.

**Risk tolerance:** High overall, but context-dependent. Some things he'll jump without looking; others he'll think through. Trust the gut read — if he's hesitating, there's a reason.

**People filter:** Gravitates toward good people who are enjoyable AND pay well. No time for bullshit or bad actors — won't hate you, just won't do business with you.
