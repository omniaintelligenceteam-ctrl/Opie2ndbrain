## Gap Analysis & Opportunities

No single platform combines:
- AI-powered night rendering
- Professional proposals with pricing
- Scheduling and dispatching
- CRM and lead management
- Invoicing and payments
- Job costing and reporting

Contractors currently need 2-4 different tools to run their business.

#### 2. **Manufacturer Lock-In**
- FX Luminaire My Design: Only FX products
- Lighting BOSS PRO: Tied to their supply business
- Opportunity: Manufacturer-agnostic platform that works with any fixtures

#### 3. **Poor Mobile Experience**
- LMN Crew app: 2.7 stars on Google Play
- Most design tools are desktop-first
- Opportunity: Mobile-first with excellent tablet experience for on-site selling

#### 4. **Expensive & Complex Onboarding**
- LMN: $800-$1,500 onboarding fees
- Aspire: $50k+ annual cost
- Steep learning curves cited repeatedly
- Opportunity: Self-service onboarding, intuitive UX

#### 5. **Per-User Pricing Penalty**
- Jobber, LMN, Housecall Pro all charge per user
- Growing teams face escalating costs ($29+/user/month)
- Opportunity: Flat-rate or unlimited-user pricing

#### 6. **No AI in Operations Software**
- Design tools have AI rendering
- FSM tools have no AI
- Gap: No AI assistance for quoting, scheduling optimization, or customer communication in one platform

#### 7. **Fragmented Data**
- Design in one tool, quotes in another, invoices in third
- No unified customer journey
- Opportunity: Single source of truth from lead to invoice
