## 📝 Personalized Outreach Sequences

### Sequence D: Tech Hub (Austin-focused)

**Email 1 — Day 0**
```
Subject: Tech-savvy Austin homeowners

Hey there,

Austin's different from other Texas markets.

Your customers work in tech. They're used to slick interfaces, 
fast load times, and instant visualization.

Then they get a lighting quote with... a price list?

We built an AI that generates photorealistic mockups showing 
exactly what their property will look like lit up. Takes 5 minutes.

Matches the expectations Austin tech workers have.

Worth a look?

**Email 2 — Day 3**
```
Subject: Re: Tech-savvy Austin homeowners

Quick follow-up.

The AI turns a daytime photo into a realistic nighttime mockup.
Customers see exactly what they're getting.

Austin contractors using it are closing 30% more of those 
"let me think about it" deals.

Still worth exploring?

Wes
```

**Email 3 — Day 7**
```
Subject: One question

Are you losing deals because Austin tech workers expect 
modern visualization and you're showing them static quotes?

If yes, I can fix that.
If no, I'll stop reaching out.

### Sequence E: Luxury Market (Highland Park/Houston luxury)

**Email 1 — Day 0**
```
Subject: What luxury clients expect

Hey,

[Highland Park / The Woodlands / River Oaks] clients aren't 
like other customers.

They get architect renderings for renovations. Interior design 
visualizations. Detailed plans before they commit.

Your lighting quote with no visual doesn't match that level.

We built an AI that generates photorealistic mockups showing 
exactly what their property will look like lit up.

Now your presentation matches what luxury clients expect.

Worth 10 minutes?
