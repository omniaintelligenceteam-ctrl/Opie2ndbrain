## 📝 Personalized Outreach Sequences

### Sequence G: Security-Focused (Florida angle)

**Email 1 — Day 0**
```
Subject: Security lighting that sells itself

Hey there,

Florida homeowners care about security. But they don't want 
their property looking like a prison yard.

"Show me exactly how the perimeter lighting will look."

That's what they say. And contractors lose deals because they 
can't show them.

We built an AI that turns a daytime photo into a realistic 
nighttime mockup. Homeowners see exactly where fixtures go, 
how the light falls, what stays dark.

Security lighting that sells itself.

Worth a look?

**Email 2 — Day 3**
```
Subject: Re: Security lighting that sells itself

Quick follow-up.

The AI generates mockups in 5 minutes from a daytime photo.
Show clients exactly how their security lighting will look.

No more "I need to think about it."

Want to see an example?

### Sequence H: Vacation Rental Market (Orlando-focused)

**Email 1 — Day 0**
```
Subject: Help vacation rental owners see ROI

Hey,

Vacation rental owners in Windermere/Dr. Phillips are different.

They don't live in the properties. They care about:
- Curb appeal for listing photos
- Security for when it's unoccupied
- ROI on every dollar spent

So when you quote lighting without showing them what they'll get...
 they can't calculate the return.

We built an AI that generates mockups showing exactly how the 
property will look lit up. Great for:
- Convincing owners to invest
- Listing photos that book more nights

Want to see how it works?

### Sequence I: Luxury Coastal (Naples/Miami)

**Email 1 — Day 0**
```
Subject: What [Coral Gables/Naples] clients expect

Hey,

[Coral Gables/Naples/Waterfront] clients have high expectations.

Every other vendor shows them renderings, samples, detailed plans.
Your lighting proposal without a visual doesn't fit.

We built an AI that generates photorealistic mockups showing 
exactly what their waterfront property will look like lit up.

Matches the luxury presentation they expect.

Worth 10 minutes?
