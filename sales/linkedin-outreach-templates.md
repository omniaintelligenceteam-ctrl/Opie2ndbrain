## **SEQUENCE 1: The Problem-Focused Approach**
*Target: Established landscape lighting contractors*

### Connection Request
> Hi [First Name], I noticed you run [Company Name] and have built an impressive portfolio of outdoor lighting projects. I'm a fellow contractor who's developed something that's been helping businesses like ours close more deals by showing clients exactly how their lighting will look before installation. Would love to connect!

### Follow-up #1 (Value Add) - Send 3-5 days after connection
> Hey [First Name]!
> 
> Thanks for connecting. I was looking at your recent project photos - that [specific project mention] turned out amazing! The [specific detail about lighting] really makes the whole space pop.
> 
> Quick question: How do you typically handle the visualization piece when clients are on the fence? I know I used to lose deals because homeowners couldn't picture the final result, especially on bigger investments.
> 
> I actually built a tool that generates realistic lighting mockups in about 30 seconds from any house photo. Been game-changing for my close rate. Happy to show you a quick demo if you're curious - no strings attached.
> 
> Either way, love seeing quality work from someone who clearly knows the trade!

### Follow-up #2 (Soft Close) - Send 7-10 days later
> Hey [First Name],
> 
> Hope business is staying busy! 
> 
> I wanted to circle back on that visualization tool I mentioned. Just had a contractor in [their city/region] close a $12K job last week that the client was initially hesitant on. The AI mockup sealed the deal.
> 
> I know how valuable your time is, so I put together a 2-minute video showing exactly how it works: [link to demo]
> 
> If it looks like something that could help you close more deals, I'm happy to set up a quick 15-min call. If not, no worries at all.
> 
> Keep crushing it out there!

## **SEQUENCE 2: The Peer-to-Peer Approach**
*Target: Small to mid-size lighting contractors*

### Connection Request
> Hi [First Name], saw your work at [Company Name] and really impressed by your attention to detail on that [recent project/type]. I'm Wes - been in the lighting game for 8 years and recently built something that's helping contractors like us win more bids. Would be great to connect with another pro!

### Follow-up #1 (Value Add) - Send 3-5 days after connection
> [First Name],
> 
> Great to connect! I've been diving into your portfolio and wow - you really know how to transform outdoor spaces. That [specific project] is exactly the kind of work that separates the pros from the weekend warriors.
> 
> I'm curious - what's your go-to method for helping clients visualize the final result during the sales process? 
> 
> I ask because I was struggling with this for years. Lots of "I need to think about it" responses, especially on higher-ticket jobs. Finally got frustrated enough that I built an AI tool that creates photorealistic lighting mockups in seconds.
> 
> Went from closing maybe 40% of my qualified leads to about 70%. The visual proof just eliminates so much hesitation.
> 
> Anyway, always interested in hearing how other contractors handle the sales side. What's been working best for you?

### Follow-up #2 (Soft Close) - Send 7-10 days later
> Hey [First Name],
> 
> Been thinking about our conversation on visualization tools. I actually put together a quick case study showing how one contractor used the mockup tool to close a hesitant client on a $15K project.
> 
> The before/after is pretty compelling: [case study link]
> 
> If you're interested in seeing how it might work for your business, I'd be happy to walk you through it. Takes about 10 minutes, and I can even create a mockup of one of your potential projects so you can see the quality.
> 
> No pressure either way - just know how game-changing it's been for my business and wanted to share with someone who clearly cares about doing quality work.
> 
> Let me know if you'd like to chat!

## **SEQUENCE 3: The Results-Driven Approach**
*Target: Growth-focused contractors & business owners*

### Connection Request
> Hi [First Name], I see you're scaling [Company Name] and doing some impressive work in the [location] market. I'm a contractor who recently developed a tool that's helped me increase my close rate by 30% - thought it might be relevant for someone focused on growth like you. Would love to connect!

### Follow-up #1 (Value Add) - Send 3-5 days after connection
> [First Name],
> 
> Thanks for connecting! I was checking out [Company Name]'s growth trajectory and it's clear you're building something special. Love the focus on [specific thing from their content/about section].
> 
> Since you're clearly focused on scaling, I thought you'd appreciate this: I've been tracking my sales metrics closely since implementing a new visualization tool, and the numbers are pretty compelling:
> 
> • Close rate: 42% → 68%
> • Average project value: Up 23% (clients more confident in bigger investments)
> • Sales cycle: Shortened by 12 days on average
> 
> The tool basically generates AI-powered lighting mockups that show clients exactly how their property will look. Eliminates the biggest objection we face: "I can't really picture it."
> 
> What metrics are you tracking most closely as you grow? Always curious how other successful contractors measure their sales performance.

### Follow-up #2 (Soft Close) - Send 7-10 days later
> Hey [First Name],
> 
> Hope the business is crushing it! 
> 
> I wanted to share a quick wins story that reminded me of our conversation about growth metrics:
> 
> Had a contractor try the visualization tool on 10 recent proposals that had gone cold. Just sent the AI-generated mockups with a follow-up note. Result: 6 of those 10 came back and signed contracts within the week.
> 
> That's $47K in previously-dead deals, brought back to life with about 20 minutes of work.
> 
> Given your focus on scaling [Company Name], figured you might want to see how this could impact your pipeline. I've got 15 minutes free tomorrow or Thursday if you want a quick demo.
> 
> If the timing's not right, no problem - but the tool is working so well for contractors that I felt like I'd be doing you a disservice not to mention it.
> 
> Let me know what works!
