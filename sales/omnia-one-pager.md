## The Problem You Face

"I'll think about it."

That's what 30-40% of your lighting prospects say. Then they disappear.

**Why?** They can't visualize what $10K-$30K of lighting actually looks like on their property.

---

## The Solution

**Omnia Light Scape Pro** shows customers exactly what they'll get — before they sign.

Upload a daytime photo. Our AI generates a photorealistic nighttime mockup showing your fixtures installed. Customer sees the transformation. You close the deal.

**5 minutes. From phone photo to presentation.**

## Built By Someone Who Knows

**Wes, Founder**

I run a landscape lighting company in Scottsdale, AZ. I built Omnia because I needed it myself.

This isn't some Silicon Valley thing. It's built by a contractor, for contractors.
