Average close rate: 35%
With mockups: 50% close rate
Projects per month: 10 quotes

WITHOUT mockups: 10 × 35% = 3.5 closed = $28,000
WITH mockups: 10 × 50% = 5 closed = $40,000

Extra revenue: $12,000/month
Omnia cost: $99/month
ROI: 121x
```

**Talk track:** "One extra closed deal pays for a year of Omnia."

## 🔥 Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors
| Competitor | Strengths | Weaknesses | Our Edge |
|------------|-----------|------------|----------|
| **DIY (Photoshop)** | Free | Requires skill, slow, inconsistent | AI does it automatically |
| **Outdoor Lighting Perspectives** | Franchise support | Expensive, locked in | Flexible, own your business |
| **LightScapes Design** | Good CAD | Manual process, requires CAD skills | AI-powered, anyone can use |
| **Generic CRM (HubSpot, etc.)** | Familiar | No mockups, not lighting-specific | Built for lighting contractors |

### Indirect Competitors
| Alternative | Why They Fail |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Hand-drawn sketches** | Unprofessional, customers don't trust |
| **Verbal descriptions** | Customers can't visualize |
| **Fixture catalogs** | Show product, not installed result |
| **Sample installations** | Can't take every customer to your best jobs |

### Our Moat
1. **AI mockups** — No one else does this at our quality
2. **Industry-specific** — Built for lighting, not generic
3. **All-in-one** — Mockups + quotes + scheduling in one place
4. **Speed** — Minutes, not hours

## 🚫 Objection Handling

### Price Objections

**"It's too expensive"**
> "I get it. Let me ask you this: what's one lost deal worth to you? Most of our users are closing at least one extra deal per month with mockups. At $8K average, that's a 80x return on $99/month. Does that math work for you?"

**"I need to think about it"**
> "Of course. What specifically would you like to think through? I want to make sure I've answered everything."

**"Can I get a discount?"**
> "We keep pricing simple and fair for everyone. But here's what I can do — the 14-day trial is free, so you can prove the ROI before you spend a dime. Sound fair?"

---

### Product Objections

**"My quotes work fine as they are"**
> "How many quotes do you send per month? And roughly what percentage close? ... So you're closing X deals. What if you could close 2-3 more? That's $16K-$24K in extra revenue. Worth testing?"

**"I don't have time to learn new software"**
> "Totally understand. Here's the thing — you can create your first mockup in under 10 minutes. Upload a photo, drop fixtures, hit generate. If you can send a text message, you can use Omnia. Want me to walk you through it?"

**"My customers are fine without mockups"**
> "Some probably are. But how many say 'let me think about it' and you never hear from them again? Those are the ones who couldn't visualize. Mockups convert those maybes into yeses."

**"The AI probably doesn't look realistic"**
> "Fair concern. Let me show you an actual mockup we generated. [show example] That's from a real customer photo. What do you think?"

**"I tried something like this before and it didn't work"**
> "What happened? ... I appreciate you being open about that. Our AI is specifically trained on landscape lighting — not generic image editing. Big difference. Worth a fresh look?"

---

### Trust Objections

**"I've never heard of you"**
> "We're new, but growing fast. Wes, the founder, runs a landscape lighting business here in Scottsdale, so this isn't some Silicon Valley thing — it's built by someone who knows the industry. Want to see it in action?"

**"How do I know you'll be around?"**
> "Fair question. We're backed by customers who pay monthly — that means we only survive if we deliver value. Plus, your data is always exportable. But honestly, the best way to judge is to try it and see the results."

**"Can I talk to a current customer?"**
> "Absolutely. Let me connect you with [customer name]. They've been using it for X months."

---

### Timing Objections

**"Now isn't a good time"**
> "No worries. When would be better? In the meantime, I'll send you a mockup example so you can see what's possible."

**"Call me back in a few months"**
> "I can do that. Quick question though — are you losing deals right now because customers can't visualize? If so, waiting costs you money. What if you just tried the free trial now, and I'll check in when you're ready?"

**"It's our slow season"**
> "Perfect time to set up new tools, actually. When things get busy, you won't have time. Use the slow season to learn it, then crush it when leads pick up."

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Personalize the first line** — mention their company, location, or something specific
2. **Keep emails under 100 words** — busy contractors don't read essays
3. **One CTA per email** — don't confuse them
4. **Warm calls > cold calls** — email first, call those who open
5. **Send at 7-8 AM local time** — before they start jobs
6. **Tuesday-Thursday** — best response rates
7. **Track everything** — what works, what doesn't
