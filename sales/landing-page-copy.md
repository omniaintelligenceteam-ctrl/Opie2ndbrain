## Problem Section (The Gap)

### Headline
### Your Competitors Are Using AI. Are You?

### Body
The landscape lighting industry is splitting into two camps:
- **86%** of large contractors use AI tools for proposals
- **Only 69%** of small/mid-size contractors have caught up

Every day you spend sketching or waiting for designers is a day your AI-equipped competitor wins the job.

### Visual Suggestion
Split-screen: Left side "Traditional: 3-day turnaround" (stress emoji). Right side "Omnia: 2 minutes" (rocket emoji).
