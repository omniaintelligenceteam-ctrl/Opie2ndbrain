## Sequence A: Owner Named (e.g., Todd Meyer)

### Email 1 — Day 0
```
Subject: Quick question for [Owner Name]

Hey [Owner Name],

Saw [Company Name]'s work around [City] — you've built a solid reputation.

Quick question: How often do clients say they "need to think about it" 
before signing?

I ask because most lighting contractors I talk to lose 30-40% of deals 
right there. Customers struggle to visualize the final result.

We built an AI that shows them exactly what their property will look like 
lit up — from a simple daytime photo. Contractors using it close those 
"need to think about it" deals.

Worth a 10-minute look?

### Email 2 — Day 3
```
Subject: Re: Quick question for [Owner Name]

Hey [Owner Name],

Following up quickly.

The short version: we turn a daytime photo into a realistic nighttime 
mockup showing exactly where fixtures go and how they'll look.

Result: customers stop "thinking about it" and start signing.

Got 10 minutes this week?

### Email 3 — Day 7
```
Subject: One question

[Owner Name],

Not trying to bug you — just trying to help.

Are you losing quotes because customers can't picture the end result?

If yes, I can show you how to fix that.
If no, I'll stop reaching out.

Which is it?

## Sequence B: Company Focus (General)

### Email 1 — Day 0
```
Subject: How [City] lighting pros are closing more deals

Hey there,

I've been talking to landscape lighting contractors around [City], 
and the same problem keeps coming up:

"Customers love the consultation, but then they say they need 
to think about it. And I never hear from them again."

Sound familiar?

The issue: they can't visualize what $15K of lighting actually looks like.

So we built an AI that shows them. Upload a daytime photo, add your 
fixtures, and boom — realistic nighttime mockup in minutes.

Contractors using it are closing 30% more of those "need to think" deals.

Want to see how it works? 10 minutes.

### Email 2 — Day 3
```
Subject: Re: How [City] lighting pros are closing more deals

Hey,

Quick follow-up on my last email.

The AI generates photorealistic mockups showing exactly how a customer's 
property will look lit up.

5 minutes from photo to presentation.

Still worth exploring?

```

### Email 3 — Day 7
```
Subject: Should I close the loop?

Hey,

I know you're busy running [Company Name].

So I'll ask directly: Are you losing deals because customers can't 
visualize the lighting before they sign?

- If yes → I can show you how to fix that in 10 minutes
- If no → I'll stop reaching out and won't bug you again

Just reply either way?

## Sequence C: Premium Positioning (High-end markets)

### Email 1 — Day 0
```
Subject: What [High-End Area] clients expect

Hey,

[High-end area] clients aren't like other customers.

They're used to seeing architect renderings, interior design 
visualizations, and detailed plans before they commit to anything.

So when you show them a lighting quote without a visual...
you're already behind their expectations.

We built an AI that generates photorealistic mockups showing exactly 
what their property will look like lit up. Takes 5 minutes.

Now your presentation matches the level they expect.

Worth a quick look?

### Email 2 — Day 3

Subject: Re: What [High-End Area] clients expect

Hey,

Quick follow-up.

The AI generates mockups that look like professional renderings — 
but you just upload a photo and it does the work in minutes.

Matches what your [High-End Area] clients expect from a premium 
service provider.

Want to see an example?

Wes

```

### Email 3 — Day 7
```
Subject: One more thing

Hey,

Last email from me.

If you're winning all your quotes already — ignore this.

But if you're losing 30-40% of deals to "I'll think about it"...
customers who can't visualize what they're buying...

The mockup tool fixes that.

Either way, all the best.

## Sequence D: Tech Hub (Austin-focused)

### Email 1 — Day 0
```
Subject: Tech-savvy Austin homeowners

Hey there,

Austin's different from other Texas markets.

Your customers work in tech. They're used to slick interfaces, 
fast load times, and instant visualization.

Then they get a lighting quote with... a price list?

We built an AI that generates photorealistic mockups showing 
exactly what their property will look like lit up. Takes 5 minutes.

Matches the expectations Austin tech workers have.

Worth a look?

```

#### Email 3 — Day 7
```
Subject: One question

Are you losing deals because Austin tech workers expect 
modern visualization and you're showing them static quotes?

If yes, I can fix that.
If no, I'll stop reaching out.

## Sequence E: Luxury Market (Dallas/Houston high-end)

### Email 1 — Day 0
```
Subject: What luxury clients expect

Hey,

[Highland Park/ The Woodlands/ River Oaks] clients aren't 
like other customers.

They get architect renderings for renovations. Interior design 
visualizations. Detailed plans before they commit.

Your lighting quote with no visual doesn't match that level.

We built an AI that generates photorealistic mockups showing 
exactly what their property will look like lit up.

Now your presentation matches what luxury clients expect.

Worth 10 minutes?

## Sequence F: Competitive Differentiation (Independents)

### Email 1 — Day 0
```
Subject: Stand out in [City]

Hey,

[City] lighting market is crowded.

Franchises with big brand recognition. Established players 
with years of reputation.

How do you stand out?

We built an AI that turns a daytime photo into a realistic 
nighttime mockup. Customers see exactly what they're getting.

It's tech the big guys don't have. Makes you look cutting-edge.

## Sequence G: Security-Focused (Florida)

### Email 1 — Day 0
```
Subject: Security lighting that sells itself

Hey there,

Florida homeowners care about security. But they don't want 
their property looking like a prison yard.

"Show me exactly how the perimeter lighting will look."

That's what they say. And contractors lose deals because they 
can't show them.

We built an AI that turns a daytime photo into a realistic 
nighttime mockup. Homeowners see exactly where fixtures go, 
how the light falls, what stays dark.

Security lighting that sells itself.

Worth a look?

Wes

```

### Email 3 — Day 7
```
Subject: Close the loop?

Hey,

One last email.

If you're closing 100% of your security lighting quotes — ignore this.

But if customers say "let me think about security needs" then go dark...

The mockup fix: show them exactly what they'll get.

Interested?

## Sequence H: Vacation Rental Market (Orlando)

### Email 1 — Day 0
```
Subject: Help vacation rental owners see ROI

Hey,

Vacation rental owners in [Windermere/Dr. Phillips/Kissimmee] are different.

They don't live in the properties. They care about:
- Curb appeal for listing photos  
- Security for when it's unoccupied
- ROI on every dollar spent

So when you quote lighting without showing them what they'll get...
they can't calculate the return.

We built an AI that generates mockups showing exactly how the 
property will look lit up. Great for:
- Convincing owners to invest
- Listing photos that book more nights

Want to see how it works?

[Coral Gables/Naples/Waterfront] clients have high expectations.

Every other vendor shows them renderings, samples, detailed plans.
Your lighting proposal without a visual doesn't fit.

We built an AI that generates photorealistic mockups showing 
exactly what their waterfront property will look like lit up.

Matches the luxury presentation they expect.
