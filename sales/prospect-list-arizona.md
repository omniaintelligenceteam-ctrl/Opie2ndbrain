## 📝 Personalized Outreach Sequences

### Sequence A: Owner Named (e.g., Todd Meyer)

**Email 1 — Day 0**
```
Subject: Quick question for Todd

Hey Todd,

Saw North Star's work around Scottsdale — you've built a solid reputation.

Quick question: How often do clients say they "need to think about it" 
before signing?

I ask because most lighting contractors I talk to lose 30-40% of deals 
right there. Customers struggle to visualize the final result.

We built an AI that shows them exactly what their property will look like 
lit up—from a simple daytime photo. Contractors using it close those 
"need to think about it" deals.

Worth a 10-minute look?

**Email 2 — Day 3**
```
Subject: Re: Quick question for Todd

Hey Todd,

Following up quickly.

The short version: we turn a daytime photo into a realistic nighttime 
mockup showing exactly where fixtures go and how they'll look.

Result: customers stop "thinking about it" and start signing.

Got 10 minutes this week?

Wes
```

**Email 3 — Day 7**
```
Subject: One question

Todd,

Not trying to bug you—just trying to help.

Are you losing quotes because customers can't picture the end result?

If yes, I can show you how to fix that.
If no, I'll stop reaching out.

Which is it?

Wes

### Sequence B: Company Focus (no owner name)

**Email 1 — Day 0**
```
Subject: How Scottsdale lighting pros are closing more deals

Hey there,

I've been talking to landscape lighting contractors around Phoenix, 
and the same problem keeps coming up:

"Customers love the consultation, but then they say they need 
to think about it. And I never hear from them again."

Sound familiar?

The issue: they can't visualize what $15K of lighting actually looks like.

So we built an AI that shows them. Upload a daytime photo, add your 
fixtures, and boom—realistic nighttime mockup in minutes.

Contractors using it are closing 30% more of those "need to think" deals.

Want to see how it works? 10 minutes.

### Sequence C: Premium Positioning (Paradise Valley/high-end)

**Email 1 — Day 0**
```
Subject: What Paradise Valley clients expect

Hey,

Paradise Valley clients aren't like other customers.

They're used to seeing architect renderings, interior design 
visualizations, and detailed plans before they commit to anything.

So when you show them a lighting quote without a visual...
you're already behind their expectations.

We built an AI that generates photorealistic mockups showing exactly 
what their property will look like lit up. Takes 5 minutes.

Now your presentation matches the level they expect.

Worth a quick look?
