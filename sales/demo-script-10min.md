# 🎬 Omnia Light Scape Pro — 10-Minute Demo Script

> Use this for live demos. Screen share + follow this flow.
> Goal: Get prospect from "interesting" to "let me try it" in 10 minutes.

---

## Before the Demo

### Tech Check (2 minutes before)
- [ ] Open Omnia at [omialightscapepro.com](https://omialightscapepro.com)
- [ ] Have a recent property photo ready (use Wes's house if needed)
- [ ] Test screen share
- [ ] Have this script open but not visible to prospect

### Ask Prospect:
> "Do you have a recent project photo we could use for the demo? Something on your phone works."

**Why:** Using THEIR photo is way more powerful than a generic example.

---

## The Demo Flow

### Minute 0-2: Connect & Confirm Pain

**Opening:**
> "Thanks for taking 10 minutes. Real quick — what's your biggest frustration when you're trying to close a lighting deal?"

**Listen for:**
- "They say they need to think about it"
- "Can't visualize what it will look like"
- "Price shock without seeing value"
- "Lose to cheaper competitors"

**Confirm:**
> "So customers can't picture what $15K in lighting actually looks like on their property. They need to 'think about it' — but you never hear back. Is that about right?"

**Bridge to solution:**
> "Cool. Let me show you how we fix that."

### Minute 2-5: The Magic (Mockup Creation)

**Action:** Share screen, show Omnia interface

**Narration:**

> "This is Omnia. I'm going to show you how fast this is."

**Step 1 - Upload photo (30 sec):**
> "Watch this. I'll grab a daytime photo — this could be from your phone, no special equipment needed."

*[Upload the photo]*

> "Done. Now here's where it gets interesting."

**Step 2 - Place fixtures (90 sec):**
> "I just drag fixtures where I want them. Path lights here... up lights for these trees... maybe some downlights on the house."

*[Demonstrate placing 4-5 fixtures]*

> "This takes about 2 minutes once you know the tool."

**Step 3 - Generate (30 sec):**
> "Now I hit Generate. Our AI turns this daytime photo into a realistic nighttime mockup showing exactly where the fixtures go and how the lighting looks."

*[Click generate, let it process]*

> "Processing..."

**Step 4 - Reveal (30 sec):**
> "And here's the nighttime version."

*[Show the generated mockup]*

**Pause. Let them react.**

### Minute 5-7: ROI Conversation

**Ask for their numbers:**
> "Real quick — what's your average project size?"

*[They say, e.g., $8,000]*

> "And roughly how many quotes do you send per month?"

*[They say, e.g., 10]*

> "So at 35% close rate, you're closing about 3-4 deals a month. That's $24K-$32K."

**Show the math:**
> "Now let's say mockups help you close just 2 more deals per month. That's an extra $16K in revenue."

**Price reveal:**
> "Omnia is $99/month. One extra closed deal pays for a year of the software. Does that math work?"

---

### Minute 7-9: The Full Workflow

**Quick tour (60 sec):**

> "Let me show you the rest real quick. Once the mockup is done..."

*[Show quoting interface]*

> "...I can generate a professional quote with all the fixtures, quantities, pricing. Send it right from the app."

*[Show scheduling]*

> "...the customer approves, I schedule the install here, assign it to my crew."

*[Show invoice]*

> "...after install, send the invoice, track payment. The whole workflow in one place."

**Emphasize:**
> "So instead of juggling 3-4 different tools — Photoshop, emails, spreadsheets — it's all here."

---

### Minute 9-10: Close

**Transition:**
> "So that's it. Show them what they'll get. Close more deals. Save time on the back end."

**Trial close:**

**Option A - If engaged:**
> "Want to start the 14-day trial? Takes 2 minutes to set up, and you can try it on your next quote."

**Option B - If hesitant:**
> "Makes sense to think it through. Want me to send you a login right now, and you can try it when you're ready? No commitment, just see if it works for you."

**Option C - If needs stakeholder:**
> "Got it — who's the decision maker? Happy to do a quick demo with them too. Takes 10 minutes."

**Wrap:**
> "Either way, I'll send over the trial link. Try it on one project, see if it helps. If not, no hard feelings."

**Don't leave without:**
- [ ] Email confirmed (for sending trial)
- [ ] Next step agreed (trial now, or demo with partner, or follow-up date)
- [ ] Your contact info in their hands

## Objection Handling During Demo

### "That looks complicated"
> "I just did that in 3 minutes. First time users take about 10. Second mockup takes 5. By the third, it's automatic."

### "How accurate is it really?"
> "Good question. The AI is trained specifically on landscape lighting — it's not generic Photoshop-style editing. See for yourself — that shadow pattern, the glow on the house — it's physically realistic."

### "I already use Photoshop"
> "How long does a mockup take you in Photoshop? ... Right. This is 5 minutes. Also, can your customers use Photoshop? No. But you can email them this mockup and they get it immediately."

### "What if my customer wants changes?"
> "Just edit it — move fixtures, add more, delete some. Regenerate. Takes another 5 minutes. Way faster than redrawing."

### "I need to think about it"
> "Of course. What specifically do you want to think through? I want to make sure I've answered everything."

*[If it's real concerns → address them]*
*[If it's just stalling → trial close]*

### "Do you have [feature]?"
> "Let me check... [if yes, show it]. [if no]: Not yet, but we're adding features based on what contractors ask for. Put in a request and we prioritize based on demand."

## Post-Demo Checklist

Within 10 minutes of hanging up:
- [ ] Send trial invitation email
- [ ] Include: "Thanks for the time today. Here's the trial link: [URL]. Try it on your next quote."
- [ ] Book calendar reminder to follow up in 3 days
- [ ] Update CRM tracker with: "Demo completed (2/10), trial sent, follow-up scheduled 2/13"

## Alternative: Loom Video Demo

If prospect can't meet live, record this script as a Loom video:
- Keep it under 7 minutes
- Use their photo if they sent one
- End with: "I'll send you a trial link. Questions? Reply to this email."

---

## Remember

- **Show, don't tell** — 5 seconds of watching beats 5 minutes of explaining
- **Use THEIR photo** — generic examples are boring
- **Get their numbers** — ROI math only works with their actual figures
- **Close at 10 minutes** — don't let it drag
- **Leave with next step** — trial started or follow-up scheduled

*Practice this twice before your first real demo. Flow matters more than exact words.*
