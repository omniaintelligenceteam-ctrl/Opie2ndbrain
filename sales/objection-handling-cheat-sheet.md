# Objection Handling Cheat Sheet

**Purpose:** Quick reference for overcoming common sales objections  
**Use During:** Sales calls, demos, follow-up emails

## Price Objections

### ❌ "$150/month is too expensive"

**Reframe the math:**
```
"I get it. Let's look at the ROI:

One $8K job you close because of a mockup = $8,000 revenue
Cost of Omnia for that one month = $150

That's a 5,233% return.

Even if Omnia only helps you close ONE extra job per year, 
it pays for itself 53x over."

Pivot: "The real question isn't 'can you afford $150?' 
It's 'how many jobs are you losing because clients can't visualize?'"
```

**Alternative angle:**
```
"What does one lost job cost you? If you quote a $12K job 
and the client says 'let me think about it' and never calls 
back - that's a $12K loss. Omnia costs $1,800/year to help 
prevent those losses."
```

---

### ❌ "I can hire a designer for that"

**Compare timelines:**
```
"You absolutely could. Let's compare:

Designer option:
- Find/schedule designer: 2-3 days
- Designer creates mockup: 1-2 days  
- Revisions: 1-2 days
- Total: 4-7 days

Omnia option:
- Upload photo: 30 seconds
- Generate mockup: 2-3 minutes
- Total: 3 minutes

Plus, designer mockups cost $200-500 each. 
Omnia is unlimited for $150/month."
```

**The real pain:**
```
"And here's the thing - in that 4-7 day waiting period, 
what happens? Your prospect gets 2 more quotes from 
competitors. Speed is your competitive advantage."
```

---

### ❌ "We're a small company, not in the budget"

**Right-sizing:**
```
"Actually, smaller companies get MORE value from Omnia.

Big companies have design departments. They can afford 
to wait. They have brand recognition.

You don't have those advantages - so you need speed and 
visual impact MORE than they do. This levels the playing field."
```

---

## Product/Objection Objections

### ❌ "AI mockups won't look real enough"

**Show, don't tell:**
```
"Fair concern. Here's what I'll do - send me a photo of 
your house, and I'll generate a mockup right now. You 
tell me if it looks real enough for your clients.

[Generate mockup in real-time during call]

See what I mean? This is their actual house. In 3 minutes. 
No designer needed."
```

**Social proof:**
```
"One of our beta testers in Austin said the exact same 
thing. Now he won't quote without it. Want me to connect 
you so you can ask him directly?"
```

---

### ❌ "My clients don't need to see mockups"

**Question to ask:**
```
"When you quote a $10K job, what percentage say 'yes' 
immediately vs. 'I need to think about it'?"

[They'll say 20-30% close immediately]

"So 70-80% don't say yes right away. Why do you think 
that is? Usually it's because they can't picture the 
result. They're imagining risk, not reward.

Mockups turn 'let me think about it' into 'when can 
you start?'"
```

---

### ❌ "We already have a process that works"

**Curiosity question:**
```
"What's your current close rate on quotes over $5K?"

[Whatever they say]

"Interesting. Our customers with similar-sized companies 
see about a 15% lift in close rates after adding mockups. 
So if you're at 30% now, that's potential to hit 45%.

Even a 10% lift on 10 quotes per month = 1 extra job. 
At your average job size, what's that worth?"
```

---

## Timing/Process Objections

### ❌ "We're too busy right now, maybe later"

**Urgency flip:**
```
"That's exactly why we should talk. When you're busy, 
 EVERY quote matters more. You don't have time to quote 
jobs you don't close.

Mockups help you close more of the quotes you're 
already doing. Same effort, better results."
```

---

### ❌ "I need to check with my partner/wife/team"

**Reduce friction:**
```
"Totally understand. Here's what I'll do:

1. I'll send you the demo video and pricing sheet
2. You watch it (5 minutes)
3. Forward it to [partner]
4. If they have questions, just cc me

No pressure, no meetings needed. They can see exactly 
what you'd be getting. Sound fair?"
```

**Alternative:**
```
"When can we get them on the call? Better to answer 
their questions directly than play phone tag."
```

---

### ❌ "Let me think about it"

**Preventive (before it happens):**
```
"I know you want to think it over. What specifically 
are you unsure about? Price, fit, timing, or something else?"

[Address the specific concern]
```

**If it already happened:**
```
"Happy to give you space. When's a good day to follow up - 
Tuesday or Wednesday? And what specifically would help you 
feel confident about this - a reference call, another demo, 
something else?"

[Get commitment - day AND what they need]
```

---

## Competitor Objections

### ❌ "We're looking at other solutions"

**Differentiation:**
```
"Good - you should definitely compare. Quick question:

Are they offering AI mockups generated specifically for 
your client's property, or stock templates?

Because that's the key difference. A template of 'nice 
lighting' doesn't help. A mockup of THEIR house helps 
a lot."
```

---

### ❌ "We're already talking to [Competitor/Alternative]"

**Don't bash, contrast:**
```
"Great company. What did you like about them so far?"

[Listen]

"Makes sense. Here's the difference - [Competitor] focuses 
on [their thing], we're laser-focused on just one thing: 
helping lighting contractors close more jobs with AI mockups.

So it really depends on what you need. If you want [their 
thing], they're probably a better fit. If you want to 
convert more quotes, that's exactly what we do.

What matters more to [Company Name] right now?"
```

---

## Trust/Objections

### ❌ "This sounds too good to be true"

**Validate and prove:**
```
"I get that reaction a lot. The technology really is 
that good now. But don't take my word for it.

Try it on your own house. Generate a mockup right now, 
see it with your own eyes. If it's not as good as I 
said, no hard feelings - you don't pay anything.

But I think you'll be surprised."
```

---

### ❌ "How do I know this will work for MY clients?"

**Trial close:**
```
"Here's what I'll do. Sign up for the trial. Use it on 
your next 3 quotes. If you don't see a difference in 
how clients respond, cancel before the trial ends. 
Zero risk.

But if you see what our other customers see - clients 
saying 'wow, so that's what it will look like' - then 
you know it'll work.

All I'm asking is 14 days to prove it. Fair?"
```

---

## The Nuclear Option (Everything Else Fails)

### 🎯 "I'm not interested"

**Graceful exit + door open:**
```
"No problem at all. Last question - is it that you're 
not interested in mockups, or just not interested right 
now?

Because if timing's bad, I can check back in 3-6 months.
No pressure."

[If they say never:]
"Got it. Well, if you ever run into a competitor who's 
using visual mockups and winning jobs you quoted, give 
me a call. Happy to show you what they're doing."
```

---

## General Principles

1. **Never argue** - Acknowledge, then reframe
2. **Ask questions** - "What makes you say that?" reveals real objection
3. **Use their numbers** - Ask their close rate, average job, volume
4. **Make it specific** - "What would you need to see to feel confident?"
5. **Offer proof** - Real-time demo beats words every time
6. **Risk reversal** - Free trial removes "will it work?" objection
7. **Know when to walk** - Some no's are really no's. Move on.

## Emergency Escalation

**If nothing works, one last try:**
```
"I want to make sure I'm not missing something. It 
sounded like [restate their goals/challenges]. And Omnia 
would solve [specific problem].  

So help me understand - what am I missing? What's the 
one thing holding you back?"

[Silence. Wait for them to answer.]
```
