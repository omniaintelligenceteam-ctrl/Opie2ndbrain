## 👋 Welcome to Omnia!

You're about to close more deals with less effort. Here's how to create your first mockup in 10 minutes or less.

---

## Step 1: Log In (30 seconds)

1. Go to [omnialightscapepro.com](https://omnialightscapepro.com)
2. Click "Sign In" or use the login link from your welcome email
3. Enter your credentials

**Pro tip:** Bookmark the site or add it to your phone's home screen for quick access.

---

## Step 2: Upload a Property Photo (1 minute)

1. Click **"New Mockup"** or the **+** button
2. Select a daytime photo of the property
3. Wait for upload to complete

### 📸 Photo Tips for Best Results

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| ✅ Daytime photo (good lighting) | ❌ Night photo |
| ✅ Clear weather | ❌ Heavy shadows or overcast |
| ✅ Straight-on angle | ❌ Extreme angles |
| ✅ Full property view | ❌ Cropped/partial shots |
| ✅ High resolution | ❌ Blurry or pixelated |

**Best practice:** Take the photo during your site visit. Sunny midday photos work great.

---

## Step 3: Add Fixtures (3-5 minutes)

1. From the fixture library, drag fixtures onto the photo
2. Position them where you'd install them
3. Adjust fixture type if needed:
   - **Uplights** — For trees, architectural features
   - **Path lights** — For walkways, driveways
   - **Well lights** — For in-ground installations
   - **Flood lights** — For large area coverage
   - **Wall wash** — For fences, walls

### 🎯 Placement Tips

| Feature | Recommended Lighting |
|---------|---------------------|
| Large trees | 2-3 uplights from different angles |
| Small trees/bushes | 1-2 uplights |
| Walkways | Path lights every 8-10 feet |
| Architectural features | 1-2 uplights or wall wash |
| Entrance | Path lights + accent lighting |
| Patio/deck | Downlighting or perimeter |

**Pro tip:** Less is often more. Start conservative — you can always add fixtures.

## Step 4: Generate the Mockup (1-2 minutes)

1. Click **"Generate Mockup"**
2. Wait for AI to process (usually 30-60 seconds)
3. Review the nighttime visualization

### What You'll See
- Realistic nighttime scene
- Light cones from your fixtures
- Ambient glow and shadows
- Property fully transformed

### Not Happy with Results?

1. Adjust fixture positions
2. Add or remove fixtures
3. Regenerate

**Pro tip:** The first generation is usually 90% right. Minor adjustments fix the rest.

## Step 5: Create the Quote (2-3 minutes)

1. Click **"Create Quote"** from your mockup
2. Review the fixture list (auto-populated)
3. Add your pricing:
   - Per-fixture pricing, or
   - Custom line items
4. Add notes or terms
5. Review total

### Quote Customization

| Field | What to Include |
|-------|-----------------|
