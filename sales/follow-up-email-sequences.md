# Follow-Up Email Sequences for Omnia Light Scape Pro

**Purpose:** Nurture prospects who don't respond to initial outreach  
**Strategy:** Value-first follow-ups, increasing urgency, soft close

---

## Sequence A: The Busy Contractor (No Response)

**Day 0:** Initial cold email (from email-templates-ready-to-send.md)

**Day 3:** Value Add Follow-Up
```
Subject: [Company Name] - Quick lighting mockup example

Hi [First Name],

I know you're busy this time of year. 

Wanted to share something quick - here's a before/after AI mockup we generated 
in about 2 minutes:

[Attach: sample-mockup.jpg]

This took less time than writing this email. Imagine showing every prospect 
exactly how their property will look before they commit.

Worth a brief conversation?

**Day 7:** Social Proof
```
Subject: How [Competitor/Peer] closed a $24K job with AI mockups

Hi [First Name],

One of our customers in [Nearby City] shared this:

"We used to lose jobs because clients couldn't visualize the lighting. 
Now we show them exactly what they'll get. Closed a $24K residential job 
last week that was previously on the fence."

- Mike R., Outdoor Lighting Pros

The difference? Their clients see the result before signing.

**Day 14:** Soft Break-Up
```
Subject: Should I close your file?

Hi [First Name],

I've reached out a few times about Omnia's AI mockup tool for [Company Name].

Haven't heard back, so I'm guessing:
1. You're all set (no worries!)
2. Timing isn't right 
3. It got buried in your inbox

If it's #3, just reply "interested" and I'll send over a 5-minute demo video.

Otherwise, I'll close your file and stop bothering you.

Either way, best of luck this season.

[Your Name]

## Sequence B: The Interested But Hesitant

**Day 0:** Initial email

**Day 2:** FAQ Response
```
Subject: Common questions about AI mockups (2-min read)

Hi [First Name],

Quick answers to questions most contractors ask:

❓ "Is it accurate?"
→ Yes. We use the actual photo of their property. AI places lights 
   realistically based on architecture and landscape.

❓ "Does it take long?"
→ 2-3 minutes per mockup. Faster than driving to the site.

❓ "What if they don't like it?"
→ Generate 3 variations in the time it used to take to do one sketch.

❓ "How much?"
→ $150/month for unlimited mockups. One job covers the year.

❓ "Can I try it?"
→ 14-day free trial. No credit card required.

Any other questions I can answer?

**Day 6:** ROI Calculator
```
Subject: The math on AI mockups

Hi [First Name],

Quick math for [Company Name]:

Current close rate: ~30% (industry average)
With visual mockups: ~45% (what we see)

If you quote 10 jobs/month at $8K average:
- Without mockups: 3 closes = $24K
- With mockups: 4.5 closes = $36K

Difference: +$12K per month
Cost of Omnia: $150/month

That's an $11,850 ROI. Every month.

Worth a 15-minute demo to see it in action?

**Day 12:** Limited Time

for contractors who start their trial this week.

Meaning:
✓ Your logo on every mockup

## Sequence C: The Referral Request

**Day 0:** Initial email sent

**Day 5:** Direct Ask
```
Subject: Who else does lighting in [City]?

Hi [First Name],

Omnia isn't for everyone. If it's not the right fit for [Company Name], 
no worries.

But I'm curious - do you know any other lighting contractors in [City] 
who might be struggling to show clients the vision? 

Maybe someone newer who's trying to compete with established outfits?

Happy to reach out directly and mention you referred them (or not - your call).

[Your Name]

## Sequence D: The Re-Engagement (Old Leads)

For prospects from 30+ days ago who never responded:

```
Subject: Still doing lighting in [City]?

Hi [First Name],

I reached out a while back about AI mockups for [Company Name]. 

Checking in to see if:
1. You're still in the lighting business (hope so!)
2. This just wasn't a priority at the time
3. You found a solution already

If timing was the issue, wanted to share - we just added a new feature 
that generates 3D night views from daytime photos. Pretty cool.

Want to see what changed?

## Sequence E: Post-Demo No Close

After a demo that didn't convert:

**Day 1:** Thank You
```
Subject: Thanks for the time today

Hi [First Name],

Great chatting with you about [Company Name]. Thanks for the time.

As promised, attached:
- Demo mockup we created (yours to keep)
- Case study: [Similar contractor]
- Pricing sheet

Take your time - I'll follow up in a few days.

[Your Name]
```

**Day 4:** Objection Handler
```
Subject: The #1 reason contractors hesitate (and why it's worth trying)

Hi [First Name],

After doing 50+ demos, here's the #1 objection we hear:

"My clients are different. They don't need fancy mockups."

Totally fair. But consider:

Your clients aren't different from other homeowners. They all struggle 
to visualize something they've never seen. That's human.

The contractors winning the high-margin jobs are the ones who remove 
that imagination barrier.

Even if only 20% of your clients care about seeing mockups, that's 
20% more closes on jobs worth $5K-$20K+

At $150/month, one extra close pays for 3+ years.

Worth testing with your next few quotes?

[Your Name]
```

**Day 10:** Final Check
```
Subject: Last check - moving you to "not now"

Hi [First Name],

Haven't heard back since our demo, so I'm assuming:

1. No interest (all good, thanks for the time)
2. Not a priority right now (totally get it)
3. Something else came up

If it's #2, reply "ping me in [month]" and I'll reach out then.

Otherwise, best of luck this season. Feel free to ping me anytime 
if things change.

2. **Keep it short** - 100-150 words max
3. **One CTA** - never ask them to do multiple things
4. **Make it easy** - "reply yes" is easier than booking a call
5. **Know when to stop** - 3-4 touches max, then move on
