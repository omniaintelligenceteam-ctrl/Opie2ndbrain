#### **1. Illuminations Lighting Design** (Houston)
**Subject:** What luxury clients expect  
**Email:**
```
Hey,

River Oaks clients aren't like other customers.

They get architect renderings for renovations. Interior design 
visualizations. Detailed plans before they commit.

Your lighting quote with no visual doesn't match that level.

We built an AI that generates photorealistic mockups showing 
exactly what their property will look like lit up.

Now your presentation matches what luxury clients expect.

Worth 10 minutes?

#### **2. North Star Outdoor Lighting** (Scottsdale)
**Subject:** Quick question for Todd Meyer  
**Email:**
```
Hey Todd,

Saw North Star Outdoor Lighting's work around Scottsdale — you've built a solid reputation.

Quick question: How often do clients say they "need to think about it" 
before signing?

I ask because most lighting contractors I talk to lose 30-40% of deals 
right there. Customers struggle to visualize the final result.

We built an AI that shows them exactly what their property will look like 
lit up — from a simple daytime photo. Contractors using it close those 
"need to think about it" deals.

Worth a 10-minute look?

Hey there,

Austin's different from other Texas markets.

Your customers work in tech. They're used to slick interfaces, 
fast load times, and instant visualization.

Then they get a lighting quote with... a price list?

We built an AI that generates photorealistic mockups showing 
exactly what their property will look like lit up. Takes 5 minutes.

DFW lighting market is crowded.

Franchises with big brand recognition. Established players 
with years of reputation.

#### **10. Orlando Outdoor Lighting** (Orlando)
**Subject:** Help vacation rental owners see ROI  
**Email:**
```
Hey,

Vacation rental owners in Windermere/Dr. Phillips/Kissimmee are different.

They don't live in the properties. They care about:
- Curb appeal for listing photos  
- Security for when it's unoccupied
- ROI on every dollar spent

So when you quote lighting without showing them what they'll get...
they can't calculate the return.

We built an AI that generates mockups showing exactly how the 
property will look lit up. Great for:
- Convincing owners to invest
- Listing photos that book more nights

Want to see how it works?

### Day 3 Follow-Up Template:

Subject: Re: [Original Subject]

Hey,

Following up quickly.

The short version: we turn a daytime photo into a realistic nighttime 
mockup showing exactly where fixtures go and how they'll look.

Result: customers stop "thinking about it" and start signing.

Got 10 minutes this week?

[Name],

Not trying to bug you — just trying to help.

Are you losing quotes because customers can't picture the end result?

If no, I'll stop reaching out.

Which is it?
